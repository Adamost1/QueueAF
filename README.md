# Q(ueue)AF
### Ryan Kim, Joshua Weiner, Alvin Ye

* Background of DEQue is a DLList, because it is easier to visualize, especially using front and back pointers. When we draw diagrams it would be easier to follow than if we were to use ArrayList

## Methods implemented:
* void addFirst(String s)
* void addLast(String s)
* String pollFirst()
* String pollLast()
* String peekFirst()
* String peekLast()
* int size()
* boolean isEmpty()
* boolean contains(String s)

## Future Methods to implement:
* implement the use of Iterator

## Other things to do:
* add comments and descriptions of algorithms
* eliminate repetitions in code
